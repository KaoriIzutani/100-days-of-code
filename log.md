# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 1
### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

### Day 2: July 5th 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.

**Thoughts** I've intentionally made mistakes and try to fix to them on my own before getting a hint or watching a video. 
Isn't that the point of debugging things?

### Day 3: July 7th 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started on Basic CSS course up to Set the Font Family of An Element.

### Day 7: July 27th 2019, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Learned about WPF and how it works with C#

### Day 9: Aug 19th 2019, Monday
**Today's Progress:** Decided to focus on Python. Seems like it's an intuitive and easy to learn language.

### Day 10: Aug 22nd 2019, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Went through some more basics on Python, such as making if, else and elif statements. 

**Thoughts**: Earlier I thought it was an intuitive and easy to learn language. It still is, but is it really in demand for today's US workforce?

### Day 11: Sept 1st 2019, Sunday
**Today's Progress:** Went through some more basics on Python, this time, creating and searching through arrays/lists.

### Day 12: Sept 4th 2019, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Learned a little about React. I suppose it's useful, but I'm not the biggest fan of CLI.

I should get my feet wet with it.

### Round 2
### Day 1: Feb 6th 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I feel I need to start over with a Round 2 (R2D1). Life got in the way, but it won't stop me from coding!

**Thoughts** I am trying Codecademy per Austin Beaufort's free e-book: Web Dev Playbook. Started simple enough with Codecademy's Intro to HTML course.

### Day 2: Feb 8th 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: R2D2. Continuing on Austin Beaufort's free e-book: Web Dev Playbook. Finished on Codecademy's Intro to HTML course and had some practice with "A Better Way to learn HTML and CSS".


**Thoughts** I got confused, because I thought "A Smarter Way" exercises were for Javascript, rather than HTML/CSS. Asking for clarification from the author.

### Day 4: Mar 19th 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: R2D4-13. Have been forgetting to update this. My school let me go on an unpaid 2 week project to build up my resume experience. 

**Thoughts** I loved working on the team project, despite the challenges. Learned a lot about an Agile style project works. 

**Link(s) to work**
https://github.com/KaoriIzutani/Career-Portfolio Created a Readme doc about my project experience. 

### Day 14: Apr 13th 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: R2D14-15. Updated my LinkedIn profile. Reviewed "Objects 101" in Andrew Mead's Javascript bootcamp. Also
worked on an open source front end web project.

**Thoughts**: I'm also going to try an online hackathon. I've done one in person before, but never online, so I'm nervous.

### Day 16: Apr 17th 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: R2D16. Focused on working an open source front end web project. I learned a little about CSS Grid to arrange a 
web page's design.

**Thoughts**: It was fun to play around with the grid. Git Bash for version control is a pain in the butt though.

### Day 17: Apr 21st 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: R2D17. Updated my LinkedIn profile and portfolio. Feels like a slow day and I coded, even though I didn't 
feel like it. 

**Thoughts**: I just gotta find a way to be productive, even in the middle of a pandemic.

### Day 19: May 2nd 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: R2D19. Decided to try my hand with React, courtesy of the Udemy course, Modern React with Redux course. Struggled to get the first project working, until I realized I made a simple typo in the code (added an extra period when there shouldn't have been one).

**Thoughts**: I didn't know about this Diffchecker(diffchecker.com) app, that's how I was able to find my typo.

**Today's Progress**: R2D20. Continuing on Austin Beaufort's free e-book: Web Dev Playbook. Practice with "A Better Way to Learn Javascript".

**Today's Progress**: R2D24. Continuing on Austin Beaufort's free e-book: Web Dev Playbook. Practice with "A Better Way to Learn Javascript".

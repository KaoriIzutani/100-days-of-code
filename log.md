# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

### Day 2: July 5th 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.

**Thoughts** I've intentionally made mistakes and try to fix to them on my own before getting a hint or watching a video. 
Isn't that the point of debugging things?

### Day 3: July 7th 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started on Basic CSS course up to Set the Font Family of An Element.

**Thoughts** This looks like this would be my favorite language to learn so far. I like to have control over the look and style of a website.

### Day 4: July 9th 2019, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Continued on Basic CSS course up to Adjust the Padding of an Element.

**Thoughts**: I also spent 2 hours today revising my resume, with encouragement from my bootcamp's job placement director. Happy, but am tired now.

### Day 7: July 27th 2019, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Learned about WPF and how it works with C#

**Thoughts**: I went through the below tutorial, but I'm already confused. It's for a dev job I'm trying to apply to. It's a paid resource. Any free ones I can try for dummies like me?

# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

### Day 2: July 5th 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.
**Thoughts** I've intentionally made mistakes and try to fix to them on my own before getting a hint or watching a video. 
Isn't that the point of debugging things?

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 1
### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

### Day 2: July 5th 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.

**Thoughts** I've intentionally made mistakes and try to fix to them on my own before getting a hint or watching a video. 
Isn't that the point of debugging things?

### Day 32: Aug 25th 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: R2D32. Was bored, so I decided to create a portfolio website, with a retro Nintendo 8-bit look. 

**Thoughts**: The website is still rough around the edges. But I love the classic 8-bit look-it's so 80s looking. It's also nice to incorporate Bootstrap elements in the website.

### Day 33: Sept 22nd 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: R2D33. Tried my hand with Codecademy's free Java course. The reason I took this is because some job assessments asked about Java questions and I wasn't familiar with Java.

### Day 4: April 20th 2021, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: R3D4. I wanted to continue with my React course, but somehow ran into technical issues. I tried playing "The Self-Taught Programmer" course and that one 
worked. 

**Thoughts**: This course focused on the Python language. It seems simple enough. I'm just irritated that you have to call a function to clear your screen of messy code.

### Day 7: May 28th 2021, Friday

**Today's Progress**: R3D7. Continued with the Modern React with Redux course, learning about components in React. Also attended a Meetup, sharing my 
struggles. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't think people appreciated the struggle of just getting the default program to run (mine was missing a Babel dependency for some reason).

### Day 10: June 11th 2021,  Friday

**Today's Progress**: R3D10. Continued with the Modern React with Redux course. Finished up on components and passing props in React.

**Thoughts**: I remembered to hard code a prop. But I forgot that you could use function calls too as props. That's what I learned today.

### Day 11: June 17th 2021, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: R3D11. Continued with the Modern React with Redux course. Finished up on components and passing props in React.

**Thoughts**: The lesson was straightforward and well-explained. So it looks like you can reuse as many components as you like? Seems like it would save
you time.

### Day 12: July 11th 2021, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: R3D12. I decided to learn more about working with API's (because don't many jobs want you to work with them?)

**Thoughts**: Mei is a very engaging instructor. I almost went through the lesson, but then the Postman website went into maintenance time.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: July 2nd 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Create a Bulleted Unordered List.

**Thoughts** I've recently went to a coding bootcamp, The Tech Academy. However, I do not want to forget what I learned there. You know
the saying: "Use it or lose it!"

### Day 2: July 5th 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More progress through the basic HTML & HTML5 course up to Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default.

**Thoughts** I've intentionally made mistakes and try to fix to them on my own before getting a hint or watching a video. 
Isn't that the point of debugging things?

### Day 3: July 7th 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Started on Basic CSS course up to Set the Font Family of An Element.

**Thoughts** This looks like this would be my favorite language to learn so far. I like to have control over the look and style of a website.

### Day 7: July 27th 2019, Friday
**Today's Progress**: Learned about WPF and how it works with C#

**Thoughts**: I went through the below tutorial, but I'm already confused. It's for a dev job I'm trying to apply to. It's a paid resource. Any free ones I can try for dummies like me?

### Day 8: Aug 13th 2019, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Decided to learn Angular to make wonderful looking front end projects, but can't seem to get the command "ng serve" to work in the command prompt.

### Day 9: Aug 19th 2019, Monday
**Today's Progress:** Decided to focus on Python. Seems like it's an intuitive and easy to learn language.

**Thoughts:** Went to more Meetups and found out about a local Tech Crawl event. If I want to break into tech, might as well go.

### Day 10: Aug 22nd 2019, Thursday
**Today's Progress**: Went through some more basics on Python, such as making if, else and elif statements. 

**Thoughts**: Earlier I thought it was an intuitive and easy to learn language. It still is, but is it really in demand for today's US workforce?

### Day 11: Sept 1st 2019, Sunday
**Today's Progress:** Went through some more basics on Python, this time, creating and searching through arrays/lists.

**Thoughts:** I hadn't been motivated today to code, but forced myself to. I'm glad I did.

### Day 12: Sept 4th 2019, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Learned a little about React. I suppose it's useful, but I'm not the biggest fan of CLI. 

**Thoughts**: I'm going to a workshop tonight on how to pass technical interviews with React. Hadn't worked with React, so felt
I should get my feet wet with it.

**Today's Progress:** More practice on Udemy's Javascript bootcamp by Andrew Mead. Learned about local and global scope. Was 
anyone else as confused as I was going through the 2 part explanation?

**Thoughts:**  My brain hurts today from that explanation. I know I didn't have to memorize it, but still..
